## About The Project

Todo: when there is something inside, write a short intro to the project

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Usage

In order to use the package in your application, do the following:

1. [Generate your own GitHUB token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add the token as an environment variable (you can use any other name for the variable):
    ~~~sh
    export GITHUB_DH_UI_TOKEN="<your-token-goes-here>";
    ~~~
3. In your application next to the `package.json` file create another file called `.npmrc` with the following content:
    ~~~
    @deliveryhero:registry="https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_DH_UI_TOKEN}
    ~~~

4. Install the package
    ~~~sh
    yarn add @deliveryhero/ui.react
    ~~~

5. Start coding!
    ~~~javascript
    import { Button } from '@deliveryhero/ui.react';
    ~~~

## Development

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:deliveryhero/ui.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    cd web/;
    yarn;
    cd web/packages/react;
    yarn;
    yarn run install-peers;
    ```
3. Run `Storybook` and start developing!
    ```sh
    yarn run dev
    ```

### Local usage

It is not possible to bump a new version to `npm` out every time you change the library locally.
Nevertheless, there is a way to develop simultaneously both the library and the application that consumes it locally.
You have two options to do so.

#### Option 1: yarn link

1. Link the package to `yarn`:
    ~~~sh
    cd web/packages/react;
    yarn link;
    ~~~
2. Link the package to the application:
    ~~~sh
    cd <application-folder>;
    yarn link "@deliveryhero/ui.react";
    ~~~

#### Option 2: yalc

1. Install `yalc`:
    ~~~sh
    yarn global add yalc
    ~~~
2. "Publish" the package to `yalc`:
    ~~~sh
    cd web/packages/react;
    yalc publish;
    ~~~
3. Link the package to the application:
    ~~~sh
    cd <application-folder>;
    yalc link "@deliveryhero/ui.react";
    ~~~

Further reading: [yalc docs](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc).

#### Troubleshooting

* White screen of website death + Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component<br />
    Probable cause: you got two instances of `styled-components`: one - from the app, another - from the linked module. Remove either one of them.

### Manual publishing

‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: manual publishing is not recommended and should be performed only if the fully-functional CI/CD is not available.

*Setting up yarn (optional)*:
Please, follow the instruction on <a href="https://confluence.deliveryhero.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=RPS&title=GitHub+as+package+registry" target="_blank">how to authenticate at the github package registry</a>.

To manually publish a new version of the package, follow these steps:
1. commit all your changes,
2. run
    ~~~bash
    cd web/packages/react;
    ./script/release.sh;
    ~~~
   and specify a desired version in the end.
   
3. push version up made by `yarn` in `package.json`
4. todo: re-build and re-publish Styleguidist

## Roadmap

Todo: put a link to the ticket system when it is ready

## Branching model

In this project we use a simplified Git Flow branching model:
* `master` branch to make releases
* `dev` branch to combine several features and test them together before making a release
* `feature branches` to develop separate features

## Contribution rules

Contributions are what really helps this project to advance. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
The project tries to maintain healthy balance between a comfortable development process and restrictions that prevent everything from falling into chaos.
Therefore, there are certain rules a contributor must follow in order to make the process straightforward and error-proof.

### For contributors

#### Component requirements

Every new component should have:
* unit tests,
* at least one story of Storybook.

When modifying existing components:
* try to support backward compatibility while making updates.

#### Adding a new component

// todo: explain how to use the code generator

#### Contribution steps and requirements

The algorithm of making a contribution:

0. Switch to `dev` branch and pull the latest changes in<br />
    ~~~bash
    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev
    ~~~
1. Create your Feature Branch locally<br />
    Please, use conventional feature naming:
    * prefix `feat/` for regular features,
    * prefix `fix/` - for fixes,
    * prefix `chore/` - for infrastructure/ci-cd pipeline/etc. changes.

    Use of other prefixes like `test/` or `doc/` is allowed but not required.<br />
    Branch name should be in `kebab` case.<br />
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git checkout -b feat/amazing-component
    ~~~
3. Make one or several commits into your branch<br />
    You are free to use any commit message format, as it is there mostly for your personal needs.
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git commit -m 'added some AmazingComponent'
    git commit -m 'the weather is so awesome today'
    ~~~
4. Push to the remote Branch
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git push origin feat/amazing-component
    ~~~
5. Open a Pull Request with the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/" target="_blank">conventional name</a>.
    Examples:
    * `feat: a new amazing component added`
    * `fix: that annoying bug is finally caught`
    * `chore: deployment pipeline fixed`
    * `doc: fixed that old typo in readme`

### For maintainers

When accepting a Pull Request:
* use `Squash-and-Merge` when merging to `dev`,
* copy the `PR` name to the name of a `squash commit` (it should be <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/" target="_blank">conventional</a>).<br />
    Example: `feat: a new amazing component added` => `feat: a new amazing component added`

Please note that pushing directly to `master` or `dev` without making a PR is strictly prohibited and therefore not possible.
