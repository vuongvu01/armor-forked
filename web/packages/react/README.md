## About The Project

Todo: when there is something inside, write a short intro to the project

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Usage

To use the UI offered by this project you need to install an NPM package and consume it in the code of your application.
In order to do that, following these steps:

1. [Generate your own GitHUB token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add the token as an environment variable (you can use any other name for the variable):
    ~~~sh
    export GITHUB_PKG_TOKEN="<your-token-goes-here>";
    ~~~
   Add the same line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (Mac) to keep this variable between laptop restarts.
3. In your application next to the `package.json` file create another file called `.npmrc` with the following content:
    ~~~
    @deliveryhero:registry="https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_PKG_TOKEN}
    ~~~
    If you already have this file, just to append the lines above to it.
4. Install the package
    ~~~sh
    yarn add @deliveryhero/ui.react
    ~~~
5. Start coding!
    ~~~javascript
    import { Button } from '@deliveryhero/ui.react';
    ~~~

## Development

If you wish to make a contribution to the library, you need to setup the development environment on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:deliveryhero/ui.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    cd web/;
    yarn;
    cd web/packages/react;
    yarn;
    yarn run install-peers;
    ```
3. We utilise `Storybook` as a primary tool for development. To launch `Storybook`, type
    ```sh
    yarn;
    yarn run dev;
    ```

### Local usage

You may want to try out the latest changes you made in some locally installed React application without bumping out anything to NPM.
You have two options here.

#### Option 1: yarn link

0. Make sure that no peer dependencies installed by typing
    ~~~sh
    cd web/packages/react;
    yarn;
    ~~~
1. Link the package to `yarn`:
    ~~~sh
    yarn link;
    ~~~
2. Link the package to the application:
    ~~~sh
    cd <application-folder>;
    yarn link "@deliveryhero/ui.react";
    ~~~

Note: in order to continue working in `Storybook` you need to install peer dependencies back by typing
~~~bash
yarn run install-peers;
~~~

#### Option 2: yalc

1. Install `yalc`:
    ~~~sh
    yarn global add yalc
    ~~~
2. "Publish" the package to `yalc`:
    ~~~sh
    cd web/packages/react;
    yalc publish;
    ~~~
3. Link the package to the application:
    ~~~sh
    cd <application-folder>;
    yalc link "@deliveryhero/ui.react";
    ~~~

Further reading: [yalc docs](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc).

#### Troubleshooting

* White screen of website death + Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component<br />
    Probable cause: you got two instances of `styled-components`: one - from the app, another - from the linked module. Remove either one of them.

### Editing the documentation

### Manual publishing

‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: manual publishing is not recommended and should be performed only if the fully-functional CI/CD is not available.

*Setting up yarn (optional)*:
Please, follow the instruction on <a href="https://confluence.deliveryhero.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=RPS&title=GitHub+as+package+registry" target="_blank">how to authenticate at the github package registry</a>.

To manually publish a new version of the package, follow these steps:
1. commit all your changes,
2. run
    ~~~bash
    cd web/packages/react;
    ./script/release.sh;
    ~~~
   and specify a desired version in the end.
   
3. push version up made by `yarn` in `package.json`
4. todo: re-build and re-publish Styleguidist

## Roadmap

Todo: put a link to the ticket system when it is ready

## Branching model

In this project we use a simplified Git Flow branching model:
* `master` branch to make releases
* `dev` branch to combine several features and test them together before making a release
* `feature branches` to develop separate features

## Contribution rules

Contributions are what really helps this project to advance. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
The project tries to maintain healthy balance between a comfortable development process and restrictions that prevent everything from falling into chaos.
Therefore, there are certain rules a contributor must follow in order to make the process straightforward and error-proof.

### For contributors

#### Component requirements

Every new component should have:
* unit tests,
* at least one story of Storybook.

When modifying existing components:
* try to support backward compatibility while making updates.

#### Adding a new component

// todo: explain how to use the code generator

#### Contribution steps and requirements

The algorithm of making a contribution:

0. Switch to `dev` branch and pull the latest changes in<br />
    ~~~bash
    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev
    ~~~
1. Create your Feature Branch locally<br />
    Please, use conventional feature naming:
    * prefix `feat/` for regular features,
    * prefix `fix/` - for fixes,
    * prefix `chore/` - for infrastructure/ci-cd pipeline/etc. changes.

    Use of other prefixes like `test/` or `doc/` is allowed but not required.<br />
    Branch name should be in `kebab` case.<br />
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git checkout -b feat/amazing-component
    ~~~
3. Make one or several commits into your branch<br />
    You are free to use any commit message format, as it is there mostly for your personal needs.
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git commit -m 'added some AmazingComponent'
    git commit -m 'the weather is so awesome today'
    ~~~
4. Push to the remote Branch
    Example:
    ~~~bash
    git push origin feat/amazing-component
    ~~~
5. Open a Pull Request with the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/" target="_blank">conventional name</a>.
    Examples:
    * `feat: a new amazing component added`
    * `fix: that annoying bug is finally caught`
    * `chore: deployment pipeline fixed`
    * `doc: fixed that old typo in readme`

### For maintainers

When accepting a Pull Request:
* use `Squash-and-Merge` when merging to `dev`,
* copy the `PR` name to the name of a `squash commit` (it should be <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/" target="_blank">conventional</a>).<br />
    Example: `feat: a new amazing component added` => `feat: a new amazing component added`

Please note that pushing directly to `master` or `dev` without making a PR is strictly prohibited and therefore not possible.
